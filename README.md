This is a website I made for a family friend for a local church. Unfortuntately at the time I had no knowledge of bootstrap and my CSS skills were not as good. This means it is not mobile or small screen friendly. A future project may be dont to make the website responsive and improve the navigation menus CSS.

The site was built heavily using PHP and a bit of JQuery.

Site Features:

- News feed on the front page
- Image gallery
- Relevant pages the church wanted
- admin area where you can edit/post new news, upload images (add to gallery) and uploads PDFs
- SQL database that stores news and user (admin) data
